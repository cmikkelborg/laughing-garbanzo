while (inf >> intv)
  check if need to insert before 1st
      if so, then do
  while (moving through list)
      if (reach numb->next == NULL)
          then insert after
      else if (n1 <= n2)
          then switch
      else move the pointer to the next falue

---open disk file
---create first node
---read 1st value from file into that node (check to see if file-read FAILED)
---make that 1st node the listHead
---make a second node, named newNode (which begins life empty)
--while ( read from file into newNode successfully?)
  ---if NOT a successful read, not executing this loop! Have run out of file contents

  ---is the newNode value < the value in headList?
  ---if so, put newNode at the head of the list
  ---else {
    ---establish boolean variable "inserted" and initialize to false
    ---set up my "movingPtr" to scan through the list by assigning listHead to it
    ----while ( ! inserted )
    ---is movingPtr->nextNode == NULL ? // Did we reach end of list?
    
     ----if so, put the newNode AFTER the one movingPtr is pointing to and make inserted true
     ----else is the value in the node AFTER the one pointed to by movingPtr >= the newNode?
     
     if so, insert the newNode after movingPtr node and before the one beyond, 
     and make inserted true

     else advance movingPtr to point to the next node in the list, and (inner) loop 
     } end of inner loop
  } end of "else"
  make newNode point to a new empty node and loop up to try to read a value into it
}

here I'm beyond both the inner and outer loop
I've got one extra node that didn't get read into. delete it..

Now print out the list.
